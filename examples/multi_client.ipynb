    "# Multi-Client Example\n",
    "*BeamNG.tech / BeamNG.drive*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to connect multiple `BeamNGpy` instances to the simulator and have them control different vehicles. For demonstration purposes, both instances are housed in the same Python process, but the same example could be used from an entirely different process or machine as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario will be a rather simple one: there are two vehicles on the `smallgrid` map (an infinite flat plane) and one vehicle will randomly drive around, controlled by client A, with another vehicle, controlled by client B, mimicking A's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to other examples, we will be using two instances of the `BeamNGpy` class representing two clients A and B. In our case, client A will create the scenario containing both vehicles, but client B will later connect and control one of the vehicles while A controls the other. The classes involved in this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BeamNGpy`: Two instances of this will be used to implement client A and B\n",
    "* `Scenario`: Client A will create a scenario for both clients to play in\n",
    "* `Vehicle`: Used to specify and control vehicles involved in the scenario\n",
    "* `Electrics`: A sensor used to inspect interal systems of the vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "The code starts with importing the respective classes:"
