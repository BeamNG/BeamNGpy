    "These are the usual imports to create a simple scenario. As the point is to show the mod support, nothing is happening in the scenario. The mod only prints some text to the console, so take a look at the console or the log file you can find in the userpath `%localappdata%\\BeamNG.tech\\<version>`. Note that the console only flushes the last line to the log file if another console output line is generated.\n",
