BeamNG Simulink generic interface
*********************************

About
^^^^^

We are excited to announce that the highly requested feature of interfacing `BeamNG.Tech <https://documentation.beamng.com/beamng_tech>`_ in `Simulink <https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html>`_ is here. The user can connect the BeamNG simulator with a specially designed Simulink S-function, which will allow management of a tightly coupled two-way communication between these two environments. The major focus here is on allowing native Simulink code to control and query a vehicle in BeamNG. This includes various powertrain properties, including wheel torques (both drive and brake), or pedal inputs.

The integration is available at https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNG-Simulink_generic_interface.
