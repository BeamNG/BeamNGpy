    The damage sensor retrieves information about how damaged the structure
    of the vehicle is. It's important to realise that this is a sensor that has
    no analogue in real life as it returns a perfect knowledge overview of how
    deformed the vehicle is. It's therefore more of a ground truth than
    simulated sensor data.
