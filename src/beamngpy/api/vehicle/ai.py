        This can be used to make the vehicle drive a long a polyline with speed
        implicitly expressed in the time between points.

        Args:
            script: A list of nodes in the script. Each node is expected to be a
                    dict-like that has ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` entries for the supposed
                    position of the vehicle, and a ``t`` entry for the time of the
                    node along the path. Time values are in seconds relative to the
                    time when script playback is started.
            cling: A flag that makes the simulator cling z-coordinates to the ground.
                   Since computing z-coordinates in advance without knowing the level
                   geometry can be cumbersome, this flag is used to automatically set
                   z-coordinates in the script to the ground height. Defaults to True.

        Notes:
            The AI follows the given script the best it can. It cannot drive
            along scripts that would be physically impossible, e.g. specifying
            a script with points A & B one kilometer apart and giving it a
            a second between those points will make the AI drive from A to B as
            fast as it can, but unlikely to reach it in the given time.
            Furthermore, if the AI falls behind schedule, it will start
            skipping points in the script in an effort to make up for
            lost time.

        Raises:
            BNGValueError: If the script has fewer than three nodes, the
                           minimum length of a script.
